This temple is a classical example of the architectural style of Kerala and has one monumental tower on each of the four sides in addition to a kuttambalam. Mural paintings depicting various scenes from the Mahabharata can be seen inside the temple.[1][2][3] The shrines and the Kuttambalam display vignettes carved in wood. The temple, along with the mural paintings, has been declared as a National Monument by India under the AMASR Act.[4] According to popular local lore, this is the first temple built by Parasurama, the sixth avatara of Vishnu. Thekkinkadu maidanam, encircling the Vadakkunnathan Temple, is the main venue of the renowned Thrissur Pooram festival.[1][2]
