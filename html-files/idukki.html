     <p class="container" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Idukki is a district in the Indian state of Kerala.[1] It was constituted on 26 January 1972, by splitting the district of Kottayam into two parts. Its division was earlier headquartered at Kottayam city, but moved to Painavu in June 1976. Idukki district lies amid the Western Ghats of Kerala. Though it is regarded as the second-largest district in the region, it has the lowest population density among the districts of Kerala,[2] the urban population being higher than the rural. Idukki is rich in forests and also known as the "Spice Garden of Kerala".

              <p class="card-text">The very sound of the word Thekkady conjures up images of elephants, unending chains of hills and spice scented plantations. The Periyar forests of Thekkady is one of the finest wildlife reserves in India. Spreads across the entire district are the picturesque plantations and hill towns that nestle beautiful trails for treks and mountain walks.

              <p class="card-text">Munnar rises as three mountain streams merge – Mudrapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundala. 1,600 m above sea level, this hill station was once the summer resort of the erstwhile British Government in South India. Sprawling tea plantations, picturesque towns, winding lanes and holiday facilities make this a popular resort town. Among the exotic flora found in the forests and grasslands here is the Neelakurinji. This flower which bathes the hills in blue once in every twelve years, will bloom next in 2018. Munnar also has the highest peak in South India, Anamudi, which towers over 2,695 m. Anamudi is an ideal spot for trekking.

              <p class="card-text">Ramakalmedu is a historic site with a Monument to Kuravan and Kurathi – a large statue that depicts the Sangam Period and Sangam landscape of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The monument provides a panoramic view of Tamil Nadu villages and towns, including Cumbum, Theni, Kombai, Thevaram, Uthamapalayam, Bodinaykannor and Vaiga. Rolling green hills and the fresh mountain air make Ramakalmedu an enchanting retreat. The view is striking at dusk when all these towns in Tamilnadu, are lighted.

                Rama – kal – medu literally means "Land of Rama’s Stone" or "Land where Lord Ram set his holy foot" (Lord Ram is a Hindu God in the epic Ramayana). One story says that Lord Ram along with Lakshman (younger brother of Lord Ram who was accompanying him during his 14 years exile in the forest) kept his foot at the top of Ramakkalmedu in search of his wife Lady Sita, who was abducted by the Demon King of Lanka , Lord Ravan.
                
                The Twin statue was sculpted by C.B Jinan and erected on the top of the hill in the year 2005. The statue depicts two historical characters who have some connection with the construction of the Idukki Dam. The Idukki Arch dam connects two massive rock hills named Kuravan Mala (Kuravan Hill) and Kurathi Mala(Kurathi Hill). .[1]
