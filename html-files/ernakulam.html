     <p class="container" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Ernakulam (About this soundpronunciation (helpÂ·info)) refers to the central, mainland portion of the city of Kochi in central Kerala, India and has lent its name to the Ernakulam district.[1] The Kerala High Court, the office of the Kochi Municipal Corporation and the Cochin Stock Exchange are situated here. The Ernakulam Junction is a major railway station of the Indian Railways. Initially, Ernakulam was the headquarters of the Ernakulam District but was later shifted to Kakkanad. Ernakulam was once the capital of the Kingdom of Cochin. It is located 220 kilometres (137 mi) north-west of the state capital Thiruvananthapuram. The city has served as an incubator for many Malayali entrepreneurs and is a major financial and commercial hub of Kerala.

              <p class="card-text">Bolgatty Palace is a former palace built by the Dutch in India on Bolgatty Island in Kochi, Kerala. One of the oldest existing Dutch palaces outside Holland, this quaint mansion was built in 1744 by Dutch traders and later extended and gardens were landscaped around it. The building was then the Governor's palace for the commander of Dutch Malabar, and in 1909 was leased to the British. It served as the home of the British governors, being the seat of the British Resident of Cochin during the British Raj.

                In 1947, when India attained independence, the palace became the property of the state and was converted into a heritage hotel resort. Bolgatty Palace has a swimming pool, 9-hole golf course, ayurvedic centre, and daily Kathakali performances and is a holiday destination for tourists. There is in a temple dedicated to Shiva that is the first of its kind in Kerala.[citation needed]

              <p class="card-text">The Thattekkad Bird Sanctuary, covering an area of barely 25 km2, and located about 12 km from Kothamangalam (Kerala state, India), was the first bird sanctuary in Kerala. Salim Ali, one of the best known ornithologists, described this sanctuary as the richest bird habitat on peninsular India.[1] Thattekkad literally means flat forest, and the region is an evergreen low-land forest located between the branches of the Periyar River, the longest river in Kerala.

              <p class="card-text">Willingdon Island is the largest artificial island in India, which forms part of the city of Kochi, in the state of Kerala. Much of the present Willingdon Island was claimed from the Lake of Kochi, filling in dredged soil around a previously existing, but tiny, natural island. Willingdon Island is significant as the home for the Port of Kochi, as well as the Kochi Naval Base (the Southern Naval Command) of the Indian Navy, Plant Quarantine station, Custom House Cochin [1] and Central Institute of Fisheries Technology, a constituent unit of Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

                The island is also home for other establishments associated with the port, namely, the Office of the Cochin Port Trust[2] (that controls the Port of Kochi), the Customs Office, and more than two dozen export-import offices, warehouses, a few hotels and business centers.

              <p class="card-text">Cherai Beach is a beach located in Cherai in the northern side of Vypin Island, a suburb of the city Kochi in the state of Kerala, India. One of the most visited beaches in the state, it is situated at around 25 km (15 mi) from downtown Kochi and 20 km (12 mi) from Cochin International Airport.[1]The beach is around 10 km long and is ideal for swimming as the tide is mostly low and the waves are gentle. It is known for frequent dolphin sightings. It is one of the few places where the backwaters and the sea can be seen in a single frame.[2] Cherai Beach offers the less busier and cleaner option accessible to Kochi and always attract the tourists from around and other states as well.
